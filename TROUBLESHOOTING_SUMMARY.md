# MCP Voice Tool Calling - Troubleshooting Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Ollama LLM Service - Missing Tool Instructions**
**Problem**: The Ollama service wasn't instructing the LLM on how to format tool calls.

**Fixed in**: `mcp_server/models/ollama_llm.py`
- Added explicit tool instructions to the system prompt
- Included examples of proper tool call format: `@tool_name({"param": "value"})`
- Listed available tools (calculator and weather) with their parameters

### 2. **Tool Call Processing - Missing Follow-up Response**
**Problem**: When tools were called, the system didn't generate a follow-up response with the tool results.

**Fixed in**: `mcp_server/main.py`
- Added automatic tool call detection and processing
- When tool calls are found, the system now:
  1. Executes the tools
  2. Generates a follow-up response including the tool results
  3. Returns the final response to the user

### 3. **Tool Call Extraction - Improved Regex Pattern**
**Problem**: The regex pattern for extracting tool calls was too rigid.

**Fixed in**: `mcp_server/core/router.py`
- Made regex pattern more flexible to handle whitespace variations
- Added better error handling and logging
- Improved JSON parsing with proper error messages

### 4. **Frontend - No Tool Call Visualization**
**Problem**: Users couldn't see when tool calls were happening.

**Fixed in**: `app.js`
- Added `addToolCallToChat()` function to display tool calls
- Tool calls now appear as special formatted messages showing the tool name and parameters
- Added console logging for debugging

### 5. **Weather Tool - Missing API Key Handling**
**Problem**: Weather tool would fail if API key wasn't configured.

**Fixed in**: `mcp_server/tools/weather.py`
- Added fallback to return demo data when API key is missing
- Added warning logging when API key is not configured
- Tool now works for testing even without a real weather API key

## Test Files Created

1. **`debug_tools.py`** - Test tool functionality directly
2. **`startup_check.py`** - Complete system check before starting
3. **`TOOL_CALLING_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive testing guide

## How to Test

### 1. Run System Check
```bash
cd C:\Users\Josh\Desktop\MCP_Assistant\MCP_Voice
python startup_check.py
```

### 2. Test Tools Directly
```bash
python debug_tools.py
```

### 3. Start the Server
```bash
python -m mcp_server.main
```

### 4. Open Web Interface
Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000`

### 5. Test Tool Calling
Try these messages:

**Calculator Tests:**
- "What is 25 times 4?"
- "Calculate the square root of 64"
- "What's 15 + 27?"

**Weather Tests:**
- "What's the weather in New York?"
- "How's the weather in London?"

**Combined Tests:**
- "Calculate 20 + 15 and tell me the weather in San Francisco"

## Expected Behavior

### Successful Tool Call Flow:
1. **User**: "What is 25 times 4?"
2. **LLM Response**: "I'll calculate that for you. @calculator({"expression": "25 * 4"})"
3. **System Logs**:
   ```
   Extracting tool calls from message: I'll calculate that for you. @calculator({"expression": "25 * 4"})
   Successfully extracted tool call: calculator with params {'expression': '25 * 4'}
   Processing 1 tool calls
   Executing tool: calculator with params: {'expression': '25 * 4'}
   Tool execution results: [{'status': 'success', 'tool_name': 'calculator', 'result': {...}}]
   Follow-up response: The result of 25 × 4 is 100.
   ```
4. **Final Response**: "The result of 25 × 4 is 100."

### Visual Indicators:
- Tool calls appear as blue-bordered boxes in the chat
- Shows tool name and parameters used
- Final response includes the calculated result

## Debugging Steps

### If Tool Calls Aren't Working:

1. **Check Server Logs** for these messages:
   - `Tool registered: calculator`
   - `Tool registered: weather`
   - `Extracting tool calls from message`
   - `Successfully extracted tool call`

2. **Verify LLM Response Format**:
   - Look for `@tool_name({"param": "value"})` in LLM responses
   - Check if the JSON parameters are valid

3. **Test Individual Components**:
   ```bash
   python debug_tools.py
   ```

4. **Check Frontend Console** (F12 in browser):
   - Look for "Tool calls detected" messages
   - Check for any JavaScript errors

### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### LLM Not Using Tool Format
**Symptoms**: LLM responds normally without `@tool_name` syntax
**Solution**: The model might need more explicit prompting or a different approach

#### JSON Parsing Errors
**Symptoms**: "Failed to parse tool call parameters" in logs
**Solution**: Check that tool call parameters are valid JSON with proper quotes

#### Tools Not Registered
**Symptoms**: "Tool 'xyz' not found" errors
**Solution**: Verify tools are properly registered in `main.py`

#### Weather API Issues
**Symptoms**: Weather tool fails even with demo data
**Solution**: Check the weather tool fallback implementation

## File Changes Summary

### Modified Files:
- `mcp_server/models/ollama_llm.py` - Enhanced prompting for tool calls
- `mcp_server/core/router.py` - Improved tool call extraction
- `mcp_server/main.py` - Added tool call processing workflow
- `mcp_server/tools/weather.py` - Added fallback for missing API key
- `app.js` - Added tool call visualization

### New Files:
- `debug_tools.py` - Tool testing script
- `startup_check.py` - System verification script
- `TOOL_CALLING_GUIDE.md` - User testing guide
- `TROUBLESHOOTING_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Next Steps

### If Tool Calling Works:
1. Test with more complex expressions and locations
2. Add additional tools as needed
3. Improve error handling and user feedback
4. Consider adding tool call history/persistence

### If Still Having Issues:
1. Check Ollama model compatibility (some models work better with structured output)
2. Try different prompting strategies
3. Consider using OpenAI-style function calling if available
4. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly

### Model Compatibility Notes:
- **llama3.2** - Generally good with structured output
- **codellama** - Excellent for structured responses
- **mistral** - Works well with explicit instructions
- **phi** - May need more specific prompting

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Tools register successfully (check logs)
- [ ] Calculator works with simple math
- [ ] Weather tool returns data (even demo data)
- [ ] Tool calls are extracted from LLM responses
- [ ] Tool results are processed and incorporated
- [ ] Frontend shows tool call indicators
- [ ] Final responses include tool results
- [ ] Audio responses work (if enabled)

## Success Criteria

The tool calling feature is working correctly when:
1. Users can ask mathematical questions and get calculated results
2. Users can ask weather questions and get weather information
3. Tool calls are visible in the chat interface
4. The LLM incorporates tool results into natural language responses
5. Multiple tools can be called in a single conversation turn

Contact: Tool calling should now be functional with the implemented fixes. Test thoroughly with the provided scripts and guide!
